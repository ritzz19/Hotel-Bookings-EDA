About data: The Hotel Booking demand dataset (attached) contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel. It includes information such as booking time, length of stay, number of adults, children/babies, number of available parking spaces, among other things.

Objective: I have tried to do a simple analysis of hotel booking data using matplotlib and seaborn libraries.
